Bounty Problem Solver — A truly decentralized, permissionless bounty platform where anyone can post problems with rewards and solvers submit private solutions. No middlemen, no gatekeepers, just direct problem-solving with automatic payments to winners.

Arcium's encrypted computation keeps every solution private until the problem closes. Using Multi-Party Computation (MPC), your solution stays sealed in a cryptographic black box while the network processes submissions—fair selection, zero peeking, no front-running.

Magic Block's Ephemeral Rollups on Solana eliminate fees and latency. Post problems, submit solutions, claim bounties—instantly and for free, with the same snappiness you expect from top web apps.

Solana’s high-performance backbone ties it all together, ensuring speed, security, and decentralization without compromise.

The result? A platform where privacy, speed, and openness aren't trade-offs—they're the default. Communities form organically around the problems people need solved, and solutions emerge naturally, unhindered by cost or competitive gamesmanship.

Bounty Problem Solver isn't just tech—it's a vision: problem-solving should feel effortless yet remain fully decentralized. Whether you're a developer diving into MPC and rollups, or a first-time user posting your inaugural problem, this platform is built to be approachable, transparent, and rewarding.

Dive in, post a problem, solve boldly—and let's see what emerges when barriers vanish.

When Others See Problems.
Solve Them. Earn From Them.
