Olivia — A truly decentralized, permissionless prediction market that runs without middlemen, gatekeepers, or hidden agendas. Anyone, anywhere, can spin up a market on any question that sparks their curiosity: election results, tech breakthroughs, sports outcomes, or even that friendly office bet. No approvals, no oversight, just pure, open participation.

Arcium’s encrypted computation keeps every prediction private until the market resolves. Using Multi-Party Computation (MPC), your bet stays sealed in a cryptographic black box while the network crunches the numbers—fair rewards, zero peeking, no front-running.

Magic Block’s Ephemeral Rollups on Solana eliminate fees and latency. Place bets, resolve markets, claim rewards—instantly and for free, with the same snappiness you expect from top web apps.

Solana’s high-performance backbone ties it all together, ensuring speed, security, and decentralization without compromise.

The result? A platform where privacy, speed, and openness aren’t trade-offs—they’re the default. Communities form organically around the questions people actually care about, and collective insight emerges naturally, unhindered by cost or strategic gamesmanship.

Olivia isn’t just tech—it’s a vision: prediction markets should feel effortless yet remain fully decentralized. Whether you’re a developer diving into MPC and rollups, or a first-time user placing your inaugural bet, I’ve built this to be approachable, transparent, and fun.

Dive in, create a market, predict boldly—and let’s see what emerges when barriers vanish.

When Others Watch Chaos.
Predict Them. Profit From Them.
